# 30-Day Web Development Challenge

Welcome to my 30-day web development journey! In this repository, I document my progress in improving my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building and uploading a new project every day for 30 days. This challenge is designed to enhance my web development expertise, explore modern techniques, and share my learning process with the community.

## Purpose of the Challenge
- Practice and master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Learn and apply modern web development techniques.
- Build a disciplined learning habit by completing a project daily.
- Create a portfolio of real-world projects.

## Features
- **30 Projects**: A new web project each day (e.g., landing pages, calculators, interactive games).
- **Responsive Design**: Projects are built to be compatible with both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Comprehensive Learning**: Covers a range from simple static pages to dynamic, interactive applications.
- **Daily Updates**: A new project is uploaded each day to showcase progress.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring web content.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout (including Flexbox, Grid, and animations).
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content.
- (Bootstrap, Font Awesome, or other libraries may be used as needed.)
